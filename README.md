* During the cutting stages of the smart band saw machine developed under the project, some video recordings were taken using a global shutter camera and a Raspberry Pi 4. 
* Image preprocessing steps were applied to the obtained video recordings. 
* From the 19-second video, 499 frames were extracted and subsequently cropped to convert them into a format suitable for use by the algorithms. 
* Of the cropped images, 179 selected images were used in the experimental study.
